!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The RNA-seq library was prepared by BGI Genomics (ShenZhen, China) using the Oligo dT Stranded mRNA library preparation protocol (BGI, Hong Kong). Paired-end sequence reads (at least 50 million paired-end reads) of 150 bp length were generated using DNBseq (MGI-G400), and the raw data were provided by BGI.
!Sample_data_processing = Paired-end RNA-Seq sequence data in fastq format were processed using Salmon aligner in quasi-mapping-based mode.
